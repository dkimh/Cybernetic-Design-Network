# Cybernetic Design Network

An interactive visualization exploring design as a living, self-regulating system inspired by cybernetics and ecological networks.

## Project Overview

This project presents a new design methodology where the design process operates as a dynamic network of interdependent nodes rather than a linear sequence. Each node represents a key aspect of design—such as material, form, structure, emotion, manufacturing, or cost—and creates continuous feedback loops that shape the entire system.

## Concept

In this cybernetic model:
- **Each decision is an input** that produces a design output
- **Outputs send feedback** to other nodes, altering their conditions
- **The system constantly balances and adapts** like an ecosystem maintaining homeostasis
- **Design becomes a living process** that evolves through interconnected relationships

The visualization demonstrates how focusing on one design factor ripples through the network, transforming the entire outcome.

## Features

- **Interactive Node Network**: Click nodes to explore feedback loops and connection paths
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Force-directed graph showing real-time relationships
- **Zoom & Pan**: Mouse scroll or +/- buttons to navigate the network
- **Randomization**: Generate alternative network configurations to explore system behavior
- **Path Tracking**: See how decisions propagate through the design system
- **Feedback Animation**: Visual pulse effects showing influence spread

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Dependencies

- React
- TypeScript
- D3.js
- Vite

## Usage

- **Click a node** to highlight its connections and view the feedback path
- **Drag nodes** to rearrange the network layout
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out or use the +/- buttons
- **Click "Randomize Connections"** to explore alternative system states
- **Click "Reset System"** to restart the simulation

## Design Nodes

The network includes five main design categories:
- **Form**: Balance, modularity, scale, geometry, visual rhythm, structure, composition
- **Function**: Adaptability, ergonomics, usability, maintenance
- **Material**: Sustainability, texture, material choice, aging, thermal properties
- **Emotion & Aesthetics**: Cultural reference, emotion, storytelling, identity
- **Process**: Cost & time, fabrication, assembly, supply chain

Plus a central **Feedback Loop** node that represents the iterative nature of design.

## Philosophy

By visualizing design as a cybernetic network, this project reveals:
- Design is not fixed, but alive and adaptive
- Every decision creates ripples throughout the system
- Understanding feedback loops leads to better design outcomes
- The design process is an ecosystem, not a checklist
